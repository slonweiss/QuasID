        "## Introduction\n",
        "This project aims to address a gap in open-source privacy engineering tools by developing a machine learning model for the systematic identification of [Quasi-Identifiers (QIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-identifier) in datasets. The initiative stems from a previous metadata analysis project on datasets from [data.gov](https://data.gov), which revealed a lack of open-source tools for automated QI detection, despite the existence of tools for identifying personally identifiable information (PII), such as [Capital One's Data Profiler](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/open-source/basics-of-data-profiler/)."

        "## Approach\n",
        "### Fine-Tuning vs Training from Scratch\n",
        "Initially, our team was planning on training a model from scratch. But given the nuances to the task of identifying QIs, we decided to fine-tune an existing model instead. Meta Llama 3-8B was chosen as it's the smallest of the [Llama 3 models](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/) (8B, 70B, & 405B parameter versions), with the hopes that it would run more quickly on the consumer hardware at our disposal. Llama 3 was trained on 15 trillion tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) offers several advantages versus training from scratch, by leveraging pre-existing knowledge and capabilities of the LLM. We believed this would reduce our manually labeled data requirements. Since the beginning of this project, Llama 3.1 models have been released, which may have resulted in more efficient fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hardware Used & CUDA Requirements\n",
        "*  GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, 24GB GDDR6X\n",
        "*  CPU: 13th Gen Intel Core i9 13900KF, 24 cores, 68MB Cache\n",
        "*  RAM: 32GB DDR5, 4800MHz\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure quick fine-tuning and execution of the model, the Python kernel must have access to CUDA-enabled GPUs. The Python environment should have the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN library installed to enable GPU acceleration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Developing the Dataset\n",
        "We leverage [UCI's Machine Learning Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets) to prepare our training datasets. We used different types of datasets for example **Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success, Student Performance, Heart Disease, Online Retail, Heart Failure Clinical Records, Bank Marketing** etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "We tried to use as diverse data as possible to avoid biases. Since none of the datasets were labeled for the QI, we manually labeled the fields based on our understanding, and some internet definitions for which fields are considered to be QIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially we labeled the PII (Personally Identifiable Information) fields as well but later on we decided to remove those labels from the dataset as we did not find any use for it for the work we were doing. We also collected some data samples for all the different datasets we have\n",
        "\n",
        "Our published dataset can be found on Sheet2 [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Kw-IujUPKUMSyaC0eRMWmpdWtyCspdl/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=118311510098611665058&rtpof=true&sd=true). Before use, it must be converted to .CSV, have columns A, C, & D removed, and be saved in the same working directory as this Jupyter Notebook.been dealing with.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Challenges/Learning:\n",
        "1. One of the challenge we faced during this process, there are only so many QIs, so no matter which dataset we look at we were finding the same or similar fields for eg. age, sex.\n",
        "2. The other challenge we faced was the data we were looking at was represented in different format across the different datasets. For eg. sex: M/F; Male/Female; 1/2 etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Configuration\n",
        "Several different configurations were tested, with all initial configurations quickly resulting in CUDA running out of memory. [Meta Llama's Fine-Tuning How-To Guide](https://llama.meta.com/docs/how-to-guides/fine-tuning/) was leveraged in getting the model running on the consumer hardware available to us. Ultimately, the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) & Quantization were employed before we could get the model to fine-tune without running out of memory.\n",
        "Hugging Face has examples of use of their Transformers library [published on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/README.md), which were referenced in the creation of this project.\n",
        "#### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\n",
        "PEFT is a technique used to fine-tune pre-trained models like Llama 3 without having to update all the parameters of the model, but instead focusing on a small subset of parameters (or introducing new weight matrices as defined in LoRA). This approach reduces computational and meory requiremetns for fine-tuning. Hugging Face's [documentation on PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/en/index) was leveraged in the use of this project.\n",
        "#### Low-Rank Adapation (LoRA)\n",
        "A specific technique in PEFT by adding low-rank decomposition layers to the pre-trained model's parameters. In essence, this introduces a small number of new parameters that can be trained efficiently while keeping the other model parameters mostly unchanged. The adaptation decomposes weight matricies into smaller matrices which are easier to train and require less memory. Hugging Face also [publishes documentation on implementation of LoRA](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/main/en/conceptual_guides/lora).\n",
        "#### Quantization\n",
        "Quantization is a technique used to reduce precision of weights and activations in a models computations, to lower precision. This also helps reduce memory footprint and increase computational efficiency. Hugging Face publishes [documentation on quantization](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/main/en/developer_guides/quantization) as well, using the [bitsandbyes](https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes) quantization library."

Tokens that are part of the actual input text have a mask value of 1, while padding tokens have a mask value of 0. This helps the model to ignore padding tokens during processing, as padding tokens simply ensure all sequences are the same length.\n",

        "#### labels\n",
        "`labels` are the target outputs for each input sequence. In the context of language modeling or text generation tasks, `labels` are usually the expected continuation of the input text. During training, the model learns to predict these labels based on the given inputs. In this code, labels are set to -100 for prompt tokens to ignore them in loss calculation, focusing only on the completion tokens.\n",

        "**NOTE:** In addition to requiring a Hugging Face account and API-key, the Meta-Llama-3 models are [Gated](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated) on Hugging Face, meaning they require an access request be submitted and approved by the model authors before they can be accessed. Fortunately, we received approval relatively quickly, and this did not hold up progress."

        "This project appears to have effectively utilized a fine-tuned Meta Llama 3-8B model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and bitsandbytes quantization to create a model capable of identifying quasi-identifiers in datasets. This approach enabled the model to run efficiently on consumer hardware. By preparing a diverse dataset with manual labeling, we ensured comprehensive training. The model achieved high performance metrics, demonstrating its reliability in QI detection tasks. This project addresses a gap in privacy engineering tools and provides a scalable solution for identifying quasi-identifiers in various datasets, contributing to improved data privacy and security practices. Because this is the first time our team has attempted this sort of model, these results should be taken with a grain of salt, and properly peer-reviewed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main challenge we tackled in this project was dealing with hardware and time constraints. Even with a high-end consumer GPU, the hardware requirements to fine-tune even smaller LLMs are significant. Many training and evaluation iterations had to be restarted due to running out of memory, hence the optimizations to run on consumer hardware. The successful training and evaluation runs often took a long time to run, which slowed down how quickly new configurations could be tested.\n"
